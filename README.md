It is a project called Cook & Plan. In the app you can search for recipes, their nutritional values, calories, type of diet and much more. You can also add some recipes to your favourites list and check your recently viewed recipes. Currently, when you enter a meal or ingredient to enter, you will see a maximum of 20 random recipes. In the future I will change this value to 100 and add pagination. In this project, I used the fetch method to download the recipes. The app is responsive and works properly on both desktop and mobile. The default language is English, so you will get the most recipes when you use English food or ingredient names.
Below are screenshots of how it looks on desktop and mobile.
